- Keep S06E01 reference, Mood, and Fashion displays driven by its reference JSON, with on-camera entries outside timestamp conversion, so spreadsheet updates stay consistent.
- Partition the episode's Mood sliders by the reference JSON's on-camera marker and give each independent selection state, so story and presenter looks remain separate after spreadsheet updates.
- Every person/place/work has exactly one overview card at /explore/$slug, built from src/data/entities.ts by merging guests, scene timeline and episode references; link names via EntityLink — so profiles are never duplicated.
- The site menu lives once in __root (SiteMenu) — so every page shows all pages.
